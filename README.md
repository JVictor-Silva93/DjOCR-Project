# Django Project with Tesseract OCR Integration Checklist

## Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up a virtual environment for the project.
- [ ] Install Django within the virtual environment.
- [ ] Install Tesseract OCR on your system.
- [ ] Install the `pytesseract` Python package.

## Django Project and App Setup
- [ ] Create a new Django project using `django-admin startproject your_project_name`.
- [ ] Inside the project directory, create a new Django app using `python manage.py startapp your_app_name`.
- [ ] Add your app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the project's `settings.py`.
- [ ] Configure other settings as necessary (e.g., database settings).

## Design Your Model
- [ ] Design models as needed for your application (e.g., a model for storing images and extracted text).

## Tesseract OCR Integration
- [ ] Create a form for image uploads, using a model with an ImageField.
- [ ] Write a view that handles image uploads and uses `pytesseract` to extract text from images.
- [ ] Implement functionality to save extracted text to the database (optional).
- [ ] Ensure the view can display OCR results or perform further processing.

## Templates and URLs
- [ ] Create templates for the image upload form and to display OCR results.
- [ ] Define URLs for your views (e.g., for uploading images and displaying results).

## Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test the image upload and OCR processing functionality.
- [ ] Debug any issues encountered during testing.

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Implement background processing for OCR tasks if necessary.
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of file uploads.
- [ ] Be mindful of legal and ethical considerations when processing/storing information from images.

## Documentation
- [ ] Document the setup process and usage instructions in the README.
- [ ] Comment your code to explain key functionalities and decisions.

## Collaboration
- [ ] Use Git for version control and to collaborate with teammates.
- [ ] Regularly push updates to GitHub and review code from teammates.
- [ ] Plan and track tasks using GitHub issues or projects.

## Deployment (Optional)
- [ ] If you decide to deploy, choose a deployment platform and follow its deployment guidelines.

Remember to update this checklist as your project evolves or if your team decides to add new features or make changes to the project structure.
